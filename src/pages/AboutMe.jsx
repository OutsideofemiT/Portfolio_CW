      <p>Hello! I'm carmen Wheeler, a dedicated full-stack web developer in training, currently honing my skills at SMU University Software Development Bootcamp. My journey into web development has been fueled by a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly applications. Through various class projects, I've gained hands-on experience with technologies such as [mention a couple of key technologies or frameworks].

Before diving into the world of coding, I built a solid foundation in customer service management. This experience has equipped me with essential soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and teamwork, which I seamlessly integrate into my development process. I believe that a great developer not only understands technology but also empathizes with users' needs and expectations.

In addition to web development, I have a passion for digital AI art. This creative outlet allows me to explore new ideas and bring a unique artistic perspective to my projects.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting and collaborating on exciting opportunities!</p>
